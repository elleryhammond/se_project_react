This application makes a call to an API which responds with the weather forecast. The weather data is collected, processed, and then appropriate clothing is recommended to the user based on the current forecast (seen on the main page). The user is able to toggle between farenheit and celsius, "like" clothing items, and add/delete their own clothing selections via the profile page.

Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
